## Technologies used

- React
- Axios (for making API calls)
- Bootstrap CSS (for styling)
- JSONPlaceholder API (dummy API)

## NOTES

This app uses the Axios library for making API calls. The POST, PUT, and DELETE requests are valid but do not actually modify the server's data.
This project was created for educational purposes to showcase basic CRUD operations in a React application.
